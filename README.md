**Database Name:** Event Management Company Database

**Description:** This database maintains information about all events, customers, admins, and workers involved in the event management company. The main table is the Event table, which contains the following fields:

- Event ID (unique identifier for each event)
- Event Location (the physical location where the event takes place)
- Admin ID (the ID of the admin who is handling that event)
- Worker ID (the ID of the worker who is assigned to work on that event)

In addition to the Event table, there may be other tables in the database to store information about customers, admins, and workers. These tables would likely include fields such as names, contact information, roles, and any other relevant details.

Overall, this database allows for the efficient management of events, tracking the specific details of each event, the responsible admin, and the assigned worker.
